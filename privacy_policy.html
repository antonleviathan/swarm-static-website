      <li>b) Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them.

Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture information about your use of the Swarm Site which Google uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services. Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify their cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by Google.</li>
