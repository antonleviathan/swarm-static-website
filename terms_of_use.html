      <p>We are constantly modifying, updating, expanding, and improving the Swarm Site. We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to make changes, modify, or add or remove portions of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, the Customer Agreement, and other incorporated terms and policies at any time, in our sole discretion. Material changes to these Terms will not be applied retroactively. Nonetheless, we encourage you to check the Swarm Site frequently to see the current Terms of Use in effect and any changes that may have been made to them. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will post the revised Swarm Terms and the revised effective date on the Swarm Site. No one at Swarm is authorized to modify these Terms with you or otherwise enter into an agreement with you that conflicts with these Terms, except by means of written agreement signed by an authorized agent of Swarm, and any other purported modifications or alterations or conflicting terms will be null and void.</p>
      <h4>THESE TERMS OF USE INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ARBITRATION PROVISION CONTAINING A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</h4>
      <h3>NOT BOILERPLATE</h3>

      <h3>Disclaimer of Certain Liabilities</h3>
      <p>THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AUGUR SITE MAY INCLUDE INACCURACIES OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS. CHANGES ARE PERIODICALLY ADDED TO THE INFORMATION HEREIN. AUGUR AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS MAY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND/OR CHANGES IN THE Swarm SITE AT ANY TIME.</p>
      <p>AUGUR AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE SUITABILITY, RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, TIMELINESS, AND ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS CONTAINED ON THE Swarm SITE FOR ANY PURPOSE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL SUCH INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. AUGUR AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH REGARD TO THIS INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
      <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL Swarm AND/OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SITE, WITH THE DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR RELATED SERVICES, THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RELATED GRAPHICS OBTAINED THROUGH THE SITE, OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SITE, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF AUGUR OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SITE, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE SITE.</p>
      <h3>Termination/access restriction</h3>
      <p>Swarm reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Swarm Site and its related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the laws of the State of California govern this agreement. Use of the Swarm Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.</p>
      <p>You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Swarm as a result of this agreement or use of the Swarm Site. Swarm’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Swarm’s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Swarm Site or information provided to or gathered by Swarm with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and Swarm with respect to the Swarm Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Swarm with respect to the Swarm Site, except for any Customer Agreement into which you enter with Swarm. In the case of any conflict, the terms of that Customer Agreement will control. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in English.</p>
      <h3>Reviews and Comments</h3>
      <p>We may, from time to time, permit you or other visitors to post reviews, comments and other content; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. Swarm reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.</p>
      <p>Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration; Jury Trail Waiver; Class Action Waiver<br>
      For any and all controversies, disputes, demands, claims, or causes of action between you and us (including the interpretation and scope of this Section and the arbitrability of the controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action) relating to the Swarm Site or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us), you and we agree to resolve any such controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action exclusively through binding and confidential arbitration. The arbitration will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. As used in this Section, “we” and “us” mean the Swarm Corp. In addition, “we” and “us” include any third party providing any product, service, or benefit in connection with the Site or these Terms (as well as any related or prior agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this Section.</p>
      <p>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “Rules and Procedures”). Where no claims or counterclaims exceed $10,000, the dispute will be resolved by the submission of documents without a hearing, unless a hearing is requested by a party or deemed necessary by the arbitrator, in which case, a party may elect to participate telephonically.</p>
      <p>You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, claims of defamation, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement. Such claims shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement to arbitrate, you or us may seek emergency equitable relief before the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration and hereby agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California for such purpose. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate.</p>
      <p>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators’ decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
      <p>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF; (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the limitation of liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) you and we will pay our respective attorneys’ fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys’ fees and expenses to the prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined by the applicable law.</p>
      <p>This Section will survive termination of your account and these Terms as well as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us. With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) above of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a) or (b) above of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in San Francisco County, California.</p>
      <p>For more information on the AAA, the Rules and Procedures, or the process for filing an arbitration claim, you may call the AAA at 888-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.</p>
      <p>YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE OR THESE TERMS MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>
      <h3>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h3>
      <p>If you are a copyright owner or agent thereof and believe any Content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a written notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) to our copyright agent at <a href="mailto:legal@swarm.fund">legal@swarm.fund</a>.</p>
      <p>In order to take action, your notice must:</p>
      <p>Include your physical or electronic signature.<br>
      Identify the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notice, a representative list of such works at that site. As an example, you might state that the copyrighted work that was infringed is located on Page 123 of the book “Parenting 1, 2, 3” written by John Doe, published by Rainbow Publishing in 2007, ISBN 1231231231.<br>
      Identify the Content that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and provide information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the Content. For example, you might state that the Content located in paragraph 4 of message #1234 is substantially the same as what is written on Page 123 of Parenting 1, 2, 3.<br>
      Provide a way for us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, or email address.<br>
      Include in your notice the following statement: “I believe in good faith that the use of copyrighted material described in this notice was not authorized by the owner of the copyright, an agent of the owner of the copyright, or applicable law.”<br>
      Include in your notice the following statement: “I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information I have set forth in this notice is accurate, and I am either (1) the owner of the copyright; (2) someone authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright; or (3) someone authorized to act on behalf of someone who holds an exclusive right to use the copyright in the manner in which it has been infringed.”</p>
      <p>We cannot take action unless you give us all required information, and you acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid.</p>
      <p>Please note that you can be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you wrongfully claim that Content infringes your copyright. If you are not sure whether Content infringes your copyright, you should first contact an attorney and seek legal advice.</p>
      <p>If you believe that your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to applicable law, to post and use such material, you may submit a written counter-notice to our copyright agent at legal@swarm.fund. In order to take action, your counter-notice must: (1) include your physical or electronic signature; (2) identify your Content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which your Content appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; (3) include a statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that your Content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of your Content; and (4) include your name, address, and telephone number and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notice to us or an agent of such person. If a proper counter-notice is received by our copyright agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that we may replace the removed Content or cease disabling it in ten business days. We may, in our discretion, replace or restore access to the removed Content and cease disabling access to it in ten to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, unless our designated agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the DMCA notice that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the owner of the removed Content from engaging in infringing activity relating to such Content.</p>
