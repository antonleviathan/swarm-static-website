        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#1">What does the name “Swarm” come from?</h4></b>
          <p id="1" class="collapse">“Swarm Intelligence” is a scientific field that arose from the study of self-organizing biological systems. Many species make heavy usage of multi-track systems to incentivize types of socially positive behavior. This formalization allows larger types of complex life to develop and evolve in a dynamic fashion.  In many ways, this is similar to the mathematics behind fractals. The formalization happens at the level of harmonic principles, rather than at the specific structural level, as often happens with hierarchical organizations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#2">What does it mean to have a “Swarm fund”?</h4></b>
          <p id="2" class="collapse">The Swarm Fund attempts to applies this concept (formally known as “stigmergy”) to finance through blockchain technology. In particular, reputation plays a key role as different system behavior is tracked and positive behavior is incentivized. Consequently, the greater the trust and transparency of the underlying system, the less formal command and control methods are needed and the more finance can be fully automated. Although we started entirely internally to the blockchain community, this ostensibly applies to all asset types.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#3">What is the history of Swarm fund?</h4></b>
          <div id="3" class="collapse">
            <p>Swarm Fund was inspired by the idea that smart contracts could lead to greater trust, transparency, and access in finance. It initially launched as a membership network dedicated to this purpose in the summer of 2014 and ran a successful $1mm blockchain crowdfunding campaign that was the first of its kind.</p>
            <p>After launching a “Silicon Valley” style incubator house it also helped develop, fund, and launch several projects, including Bitcoin Comic book, Woodshares, the first dedicated crypto-asset fund, and several other projects that remain in stealth mode.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the founders realized many of the barriers to creation on this space were regulatory and worked primarily on governance and organizational design, including speaking at various industry events, including partnerships with Singularity University, Agentic Group, and ExO Works.</p>
            <p>After key learnings from these engagements we began implementing the most advanced blockchain governance system developed to date, which integrated concepts of liquid democracy, futarchy, and reputational systems.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#4">What are some of the project use cases that you hope to fund with this approach?</h4></b>
          <p id="4" class="collapse">We are currently focused on hard assets that have mostly been neglected within the crypto-asset world, especially unique financial assets that would highly benefit from automation. For example, we are looking at real estate, distressed real estate, art, and SaaS platforms. All of these highly lend themselves to tokenization. That said, we believe that all types of investment are highly likely to benefit from a reputation-based model.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#5">How will the Swarm network be governed?</h4></b>
          <p id="5" class="collapse">The Swarm network uses a stake-weighted liquid democracy system for governance, of which stake is gradually sold off to interested parties. This implementation is described in detail in the Network State Whitepaper.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#6">How will the Swarm platform make money?</h4></b>
          <p id="6" class="collapse">The Swarm platform makes primarily through individual deal opportunities that the network participates in make money. This is done through what is traditionally called a “carry,” a distribution of realized return that goes to the platform. Additionally at some points we may charge a fee for project listing.</p>

        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#7">What is the current status of your infrastructure?</h4></b>
          <p id="7" class="collapse">Our MVP is a stake weighted liquid democracy organization deployed via Solidity smart contracts. It has the possibility of proposing proposals and dynamic allocation of capital to causes or sub-projects. Additionally, stake can be bought and participants. The smart contracts are open source and can be viewed here (link tbd)</p>

        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#8">Who is on your team?</h4></b>
          <p id="8" class="collapse">Our core team is largely comprised of entrepreneurs who have gone into finance after a couple of successful tech companies. Joel Dietz was an early MVP and competitive coder in the Salesforce world before getting involved with blockchain and has been involved with multiple successful enterprise SaaS companies, including his own consulting business. Philipp Pieper has built and sold several companies, including Proximic. Timo Lehes was an engineer who after a couple of exits had gone into finance and investment banking. Our early advisors also include Mark Oei of the Sequoia Heritage fund and Jack Peterson of Augur</p>

        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#9">What do you think of “the DAO”?</h4></b>
          <p id="9" class="collapse">“The DAO” was a fascinating experiment that appropriately garnered a lot of attention for doing something that was extremely ground breaking. Unfortunately, it may have attempted to do too much too quickly. Our implementation has started with a more robust governmental model and has several checks and balances that prevent technical failures from causing damage to real assets</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <b><h4 class="accordion-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#10">How is this different from the DAO?</h4></b>
          <div id="10" class="collapse">
            <p>The DAO was an ownerless venture capital fund driven by majority
              consensus deployed as a DAO. It shows, among other things, the
              enthusiasm in the market for such a solution. Its major flaws
              included a rush to market,, an overly centralized single
              implementation, a lack of a solid governance model that allowed for
              evolution, and distributed economic incentives that did not allow
              for individual achievement.</p>
            <p>Our model is different from the DAO in that each project resembles
              a traditional company in its ownership structure in that ownership
              is gradually sold off over time to the crowd and it becomes autonomous
              in stages as the technology and model are proven. This allows rapid
              decision making and iteration during the early stages of the project
              when this is necessary and some degree of pivoting and technological
              upgrades may be necessary during the implementation.</p>
